# Server-Side Protection against Third Party Web Tracking

# Introduction
This project deals with the problem of third party web tracking. Indeed, the web infrastructure allows a web application developer to reuse third party content in his own application by directly referencing them in an application. Though third party content provides tremendous benefit to application developers by allowing them to quickly build fully functional applications, it is also known that third party content poses serious security and privacy threats to users of such web applications. 

In particular, third party web tracking is a very common practice that many third party content providers have been found doing, putting users privacy at risk. In general, developers who rely on third party services in their applications, are solely interested in the content. Unfortunately, with the content can also come tracking. In this work, we propose a solution for web applications developers to use third party content, while preserving their users privacy by removing the tracking that can be done by the underlying third party content owners.
